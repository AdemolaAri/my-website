A context window is the span of text an LLM can “keep in mind” at once, basically, how much of your question + its own response it can read, understand, and use to generate the next word.

## Why context windows matter

- Accuracy drops when important details fall outside the window.  
- Prompting strategy changes: you often need to summarize, chunk, or retrieve context.  
- Cost scales with larger windows, since more tokens = more compute.

In essence, the context window sets the boundary of the model’s working memory.

## Where it’s evolving

Recent LLMs (like [Claude](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows) and [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/long-context)) have stretched windows to hundreds of thousands of tokens (long enough to fit entire books or codebases).  
But the next step isn’t just more tokens — it’s smarter memory: models that decide what to keep, compress, "throw away", or recall dynamically.

## Final thought

If [RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)](/work/llm-word-of-the-week/rag/) gave models a way to fetch knowledge, **context windows** define how long they can hold it.  
Both are key pieces in the bigger question:

> How do we make LLMs think in a broader context, not just react in sequence?
