The tennis Grand Slam season ended with Carlos Alcaraz lifting the 2025 US Open trophy in style.  
What struck me most about his game? **Variety.**  

He doesn’t just hit powerful baseline shots — he mixes in drop shots, slices, and volleys to stay unpredictable and keep opponents on edge.  

That got me thinking about engineering.

### Versatility in Tech  

I’ve never been the type to settle in one lane. Technology is too exciting to limit myself.  

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of:  

- Building backend services with **GoLang**, **FastAPI**, and **MongoDB**  
- Designing **event-driven systems** that notify downstream teams reliably  
- Contributing to the **Kroger Ad Platform** from ideation through launch  
- Crafting dynamic **Angular frontends** — including a JSON-driven UI parser that generates activation flows on the fly  
- Enhancing **Spring Boot gateway services** with **feature toggles** and CI/CD pipelines  

Each project required a different “shot,” much like Alcaraz switching from a volley to a drop shot.

### Expanding the Game with AI  

Recently, I’ve been adding another dimension to my toolkit: **AI**.  

- I’m experimenting with **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** and have two GitHub tutorials:  
  - [Python MCP Server with a Tennis DB](https://github.com/AdemolaAri/tennis-mcp-server) 🎾 (yes, I used tennis queries as the example — couldn’t resist!)  
  - [TypeScript MCP Server Tutorial](https://github.com/AdemolaAri/mcp-server-typescript-tutorial)  
- I’ve been using automation tools like **n8n** to handle everyday workflows, showing how AI can extend beyond code and into personal productivity.  
- I completed the **Google Generative AI course**, which gave me an end-to-end perspective on building real-world Gen AI projects.  
- And I’m actively **contributing to open source AI**, learning by doing and giving back to the community.  

AI feels like the “drop shot” or “inside-out forehand” in my engineering game — it adds variety, surprise, and a whole new set of possibilities.

### Why Variety Wins  

The thrill for me is in the **breadth** — the constant learning, experimenting, and problem-solving with new tools.  

Some days, it’s debugging a distributed locking system for MongoDB change streams.  
Other days, it’s wiring up a new Angular store with RxJS.  
And increasingly, it’s building smarter systems with AI that augment the work I already do.  

That mix keeps the work exciting, sharpens my skills, and makes me ready for whatever challenge comes next.

### Closing Thought  

Whether on the court or behind the keyboard, versatility wins.  

**Be like Alcaraz.** 😄
