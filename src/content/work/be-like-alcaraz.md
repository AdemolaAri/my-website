The tennis Grand Slam season ended with Carlos Alcaraz lifting the 2025 US Open trophy in style.  
What struck me most about his game? **Variety.**  

He doesn‚Äôt just hit powerful baseline shots ‚Äî he mixes in drop shots, slices, and volleys to stay unpredictable and keep opponents on edge.  

That got me thinking about engineering.

### Versatility in Tech  

I‚Äôve never been the type to settle in one lane. Technology is too exciting to limit myself.  

Over the years, I‚Äôve had the privilege of:  

- Building backend services with **GoLang**, **FastAPI**, and **MongoDB**  
- Designing **event-driven systems** that notify downstream teams reliably  
- Contributing to the **Kroger Ad Platform** from ideation through launch  
- Crafting dynamic **Angular frontends** ‚Äî including a JSON-driven UI parser that generates activation flows on the fly  
- Enhancing **Spring Boot gateway services** with **feature toggles** and CI/CD pipelines  

Each project required a different ‚Äúshot,‚Äù much like Alcaraz switching from a volley to a drop shot.

### Why Variety Wins  

The thrill for me is in the **breadth** ‚Äî the constant learning, experimenting, and problem-solving with new tools.  

Some days, it‚Äôs debugging a distributed locking system for MongoDB change streams.  
Other days, it‚Äôs wiring up a new Angular store with RxJS.  

That mix keeps the work exciting, sharpens my skills, and makes me ready for whatever challenge comes next.

### Closing Thought  

Whether on the court or behind the keyboard, versatility wins.  

**Be like Alcaraz.** üòÑ
